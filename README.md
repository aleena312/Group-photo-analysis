# Group-photo-analysis
a simple gui based on tkinter which detects faces using retina face algo combined with deepface for emotion analysis(bottom up) and a fine-tuned VGG16 for top down component to analyze the context of the group, and finding the dominant emotion of the group picture, quantifying it and plotting it on the valence-arousal plane which is displayed using matplotlib. The GUI takes input any jpg, jpeg or png image
